# Keypad
Our project is a keypad for the rhythm game osu! that has leds that get brighter the faster you tap, these leds would be behind eyes or a blush or something so whatever we end up plastering on our keypad will have its eyes get brighter / blush harder when you tap faster. 
We made the project because we got bored over the summer and I also happen to want a keypad to play osu because my current keyboard is quite low quality.

In the end I decided to have maomao from apothecary diaries as my keypad and the eyes light up when u tap faster\
