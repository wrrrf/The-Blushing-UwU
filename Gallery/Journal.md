6/3/25 changed the pcb to use an arduino micro -- 10 minutes\
6/3/25 changed the pcb back to using the XIAO RP 2040 DIP -- 0.5 minutes (pressed ctrl + z alot)\
6/3/25 moved all components except for some pcb routes to the front of the pcb -- 5 minutes\
    ![Components moved to front](./06-03-25.jpg)\
6/3/25 began modeling the case, fit the case to the PCB and keys -- 1 hour\
    some stuff isn't quite accurate, and just a box right now\
    ![Model so far](./06-03-25-1.jpg)\
6/4/25 started on the software for the keypad -- 30 minutes\
6/4/25 continued working on the model -- 30 minutes\
