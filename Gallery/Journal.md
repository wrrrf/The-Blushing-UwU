6/2/2025 made the 1st prototype pcb for the keypad -- ~3 hours
    3 key keypad, 2 LEDs, using the Seeed studio XIAO RP 2040 DIP as the promary chip 
    ![Initial PCB Design](./06-02-25.jpg)

6/3/25 changed the pcb to use an arduino micro
6/3/25 changed the pcb back to using the XIAO RP 2040 DIP
6/3/25 moved all components except for some pcb routes to the front of the pcb
6/3/25 began modeling the case, fit the case to the PCB and keys
